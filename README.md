Financial transactions are vital components of modern economies but are susceptible to fraud. This study presents a fraud detection system leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify and mitigate fraudulent activities. The system achieved an accuracy of 85.57% using the Random Forest algorithm on simulated credit card transaction data.
Methodology
- **Data Acquisition:** Simulated credit card transactions using the Sparkov Data Generation tool and Kaggle's "Fraud Detection" dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
- **Model Building:** Using Random Forest and addressing class imbalance through under sampling.
Findings
- Distribution of fraudulent transactions across categories and demographics.
- Temporal and geographic trends in fraudulent activity.
Conclusion
The developed system shows significant potential in enhancing the security of financial transactions by accurately detecting fraud.
